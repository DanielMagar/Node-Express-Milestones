ðŸ”§ 1. What are Node.js Modules?
  - A module is a functionslity which is organised in a single or multiple JavaScript file(s) that can be 
    reused throughout the Node.js application.

    In Node.js, modules are reusable pieces of code â€” like functions, objects, or entire files â€” that can be imported/exported between files. They help you organize your code into manageable chunks

    A module in Node.js is a self-contained block of code that provides specific functionality. 
    Modules help you:

        i.   Organize code into logical units

        ii.  Encapsulate functionality

        iii. Promote code reusability

        iv.  Prevent polluting the global namespace

        v.   Manage dependencies effectively

   Each module has its own scope - variables, functions, and objects defined in a module are private to 
   that module unless explicitly exported.

2. Types of modules -
   i. Core modules (Built-in-module)
   ii. Third Party Modules (Node Package Manager)
   iii. Local Module (user Defined Module)

   ðŸ“¦ Types of Node.js Modules
     1. Built-in (Core) Modules
            These are provided by Node.js out of the box. No need to install anything.

            Examples:

            fs â†’ File system (read/write files)

            http â†’ Create a web server

            path â†’ Handle file paths

            os â†’ Info about your operating system

            crypto â†’ Encryption utilities.

            Examples:
                const fs = require('fs');
                const path = require('path');
      
      2. Third-party Modules
            These are installed via npm (Node Package Manager), like express, axios, lodash, etc.

            Example:
             Installation of third party module:

               npm install express

             Using the third party module:

               const express = require('express');
               const app = express();

        3. Local Modules
            Modules you create yourself in your project.

            Example:
                // myModule.js
                function greet(name) {
                  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
                }
                module.exports = greet;

                // app.js
                const greet = require('./myModule');
                console.log(greet('Daniel')); // Hello, Daniel!
