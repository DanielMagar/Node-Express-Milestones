1. What is a Module ?
  - A module is a functionslity which is organised in a single or multiple JavaScript file(s) that can be 
    reused throughout the Node.js application.

    A module in Node.js is a self-contained block of code that provides specific functionality. 
    Modules help you:

        i.   Organize code into logical units

        ii.  Encapsulate functionality

        iii. Promote code reusability

        iv.  Prevent polluting the global namespace

        v.   Manage dependencies effectively

   Each module has its own scope - variables, functions, and objects defined in a module are private to 
   that module unless explicitly exported.

2. Types of modules -
   i. Core modules (Built-in-module)
   ii. Third Party Modules (Node Package Manager)
   iii. Local Module (user Defined Module)
