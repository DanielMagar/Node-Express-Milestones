⚙️ Core Difference Between Synchronous and Asynchronous File System:

    Synchronous = Blocking
    Asynchronous = Non-blocking

🔧 Functional Level Difference

Feature	                Synchronous (Sync)	                            Asynchronous (Async)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Execution Flow:	        Waits until the file operation is complete	    Does not wait — continues to next instruction
Thread Blocking:	    Yes — blocks the event loop	                    No — uses callbacks or Promises to handle result
Performance:	        Slower for I/O-heavy apps	                    Faster, efficient under heavy load
Error Handling:	        Use try/catch	                                Use callback or .catch() in Promises
API Style:	            fs.writeFileSync()	                            fs.writeFile()


🧠 Behind the Scenes (How It Works)
        🟡 Synchronous:
                       const data = fs.readFileSync('file.txt'); // Waits here until reading is done
                       console.log('Data:', data);

                       //
                       - The event loop is blocked until file reading is complete.

                       - Good for scripts or tasks that must finish step-by-step.
        🔵 Asynchronous:
                        fs.readFile('file.txt', (err, data) => {
                        if (err) throw err;
                        console.log('Data:', data);
                        });
                        console.log('This runs before file is read!');
                        //
                        - Node sends the file reading task to the system.

                        - It continues executing the rest of the code.

                        - When the system finishes, it triggers the callback.

    🧪 Use Case Level Difference

Situation	                    Synchronous	                                Asynchronous
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Small setup 
scripts 
(e.g., build tools, migrations)	✅ Yes	                                    ✅ Yes

Server-side app 
(like Express.js)	            🚫 Avoid (can freeze app for all users)	     ✅ Use

One-time file write 
during app start	            ✅ Okay	                                    ✅ Okay

Reading/writing large 
files or multiple files	        🚫 Slower	                                 ✅ Non-blocking and efficient

Debugging/test code	            ✅ Easier to follow	                        ✅ Possible, but async flow can be tricky


🧪 Summary:

    - Use Sync only when you must wait for the result or in CLI tools.

    - Use Async in servers, APIs, or anything concurrent.

💡 Quick Tip
For real-world web servers or APIs: Always use async to avoid blocking other requests.
