üì¶ What is the request Package in Node.js?
    The request package was a popular third-party Node.js module used to make HTTP requests ‚Äî like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE ‚Äî to APIs or web servers.

    It simplified working with REST APIs and external web services.

‚úÖ Common Use Case:
   const request = require('request');

    request('https://api.example.com/data', (error, response, body) => {
    if (!error && response.statusCode === 200) {
        console.log(body); // print the response body
    }
    });
    ‚ö†Ô∏è But wait ‚Äî Important Note:
        The request package is now deprecated since February 2020 and is no longer maintained.

        So while it still works, it's not recommended for new projects.
  ‚úÖ Modern Alternatives (You Should Use Instead):
    | Package          | Features                                         |
    | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
    | **`axios`**      | Promise-based, modern, supports `async/await`    |
    | **`node-fetch`** | Lightweight, uses `fetch` API like in browsers   |
    | **`got`**        | Powerful, feature-rich, great for advanced usage |


NOTE: You need to install Request Package inorder to use, node alone will not provide by default
