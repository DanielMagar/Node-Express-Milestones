üß† What is Callback Abstraction?

Callback abstraction means:

Instead of hardcoding what happens after an operation, you allow the caller to pass in a custom callback ‚Äî making your function flexible.

This is useful when:
- You want to reuse the same logic but change what happens after it finishes.
- You‚Äôre working with async functions like fs.readFile, API calls, or timers.
üîÅ Real-Life Analogy
Imagine a microwave:

You set a timer.

After it's done, you choose what to do: eat, serve, reheat.

‚û°Ô∏è The microwave (function) is fixed, but the next step (callback) is custom.

‚úÖ Key Benefits of Callback Abstraction

| Benefit         | Why it matters                                 |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Reusability** | Same function, different outcomes              |
| **Decoupling**  | Caller decides *what happens next*             |
| **Scalability** | Works great in async (like APIs, file systems) |
| **Clean code**  | Less repetition, more control                  |
