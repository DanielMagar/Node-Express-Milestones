ðŸŒ± 1: What is Node.js?
    Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chromeâ€™s V8 engine. It lets you run JavaScript on the server, not just in the browser.

    It's event-driven and non-blocking, which makes it great for scalable apps.

    You write JavaScript to build backend services like APIs or servers.

âš¡ 2. Why Use Node.js?
        1. JavaScript Everywhere (Full-Stack JS)
           You can use JavaScript on both the frontend (React, Angular, Vue) and backend (Node.js).

           No context switching between languages = faster development & easier to manage.

        2. Fast & Non-Blocking I/O
           Node.js uses asynchronous, event-driven architecture, which makes it extremely fast for handling multiple requests â€” perfect for real-time apps, chat apps, and APIs.

        3. Lightweight and Scalable
           Ideal for microservices or serverless setups.

           Works well for APIs, single-page apps, and real-time systems (e.g. gaming, chat, collaboration).

        4. Massive Ecosystem (npm)
           Access to over 1 million packages via npm.

           Youâ€™ll rarely need to reinvent the wheel.

        5. Community and Jobs
           Huge community = more learning resources and help.

           Tons of demand for full-stack JavaScript devs (React + Node is ðŸ”¥).
